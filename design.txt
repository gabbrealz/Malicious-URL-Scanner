The app is divided into 2 sections, CLIENT and SERVER.
- The CLIENT is the program run by end users, who can check if a URL is safe.
- The SERVER is a lightweight HTTP server in Python containing the master list of malicious URLs
    - The SERVER provides the query endpoint for the CLIENT to do confirmation checks on a URL

=============================================================================================================

CLIENT:
    1. Requires a bloom filter pickle file to exist
        1.1. If it doesn't exist, request data from the server to rebuild the pickle file
        1.2. Upon running the program, the bloom filter pickle file is loaded into memory

    2. Internal operations will be written to a log file
        2.1. Events will be kept hidden in the app itself, but they will be saved in a log file

    3. The client can submit a URL to be blacklisted by the server

    4. The client can request an updated list from the server to rebuild the bloom filter
    
    5. The bloom filter will be used during look-ups
        5.1. If the check returns True, query the server for a full check

    6. The client must provide a valid name for logging purposes
        6.1. The name will be sent through HTTP requests

SERVER:
    1. Must have partitioned index files holding the list of malicious sites
        1.1. Index files are partitioned by key ranges
            - Partition 1: 0x00 - 0x3F
            - Partition 2: 0x40 - 0x7F
            - Partition 3: 0x80 - 0xBF
            - Partition 4: 0xC0 - 0xFF
        1.2. Each index file is built as a binary flat file of SHA-256 hashed URLs sorted lexicographically
            1.2.1. Each index file must contain exactly 15,625 hashes (500,000 bytes)
    
    2. Servers have multiple Memtables stored in RAM during runtime for new writes
        2.1. There should be 1 Memtable for every index file partition
        2.2. Every time a new URL gets blacklisted, it writes to a WAL (log file)
        2.3. The new URL also gets added to a Memtable, implemented using Red Black Tree
        2.4. When any Memtable reaches a size threshold, it gets flushed to a new index file
            2.3.1. The Memtable gets written into an index file on disk in its respective partition

    3. Servers will have query endpoints for lookups and insertions only
